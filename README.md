# HourRegistration
automatically registers worked hours

make a file in the same folder called Registration.txt 
in the Registration.txt file all worked minutes will appear as well as the total amount o minutes worked

this program is terminal based (at least so far)

an example of how things will appear in the file:
Checked in  for project x on Fri Feb  7 15:08:54 2020
Checked out for project x on Fri Feb  7 15:10:02 2020
Minutes worked: 1
New total minutes worked: 9
